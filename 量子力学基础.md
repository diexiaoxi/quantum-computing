# Copenhagen interpretation  哥本哈根解释

A pure state in quantum mechanics is represented in terms of a normalized
vector $|\psi\right\rangle$ in a Hilbert space (a complex vector space with an
inner product): $\left \langle \psi|\psi \right \rangle = 1 $. Suppose two states $|\psi_1\right\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\right\rangle$ are physical states of the system. Then their linear superposition $c_1|\psi_1\right\rangle + c_2|\psi_2\right\rangle$
$(c_k \in C$ is also a possible state of the same system. This is called the **superposition principle**.
